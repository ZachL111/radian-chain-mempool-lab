# radian-chain-mempool-lab

`radian-chain-mempool-lab` is a C project for Blockchain tooling. It turns implement a C blockchain tooling project for mempool state machine modeling, using transition tables and invalid-transition tests into a small local model with readable fixtures and a direct verification command.

## Reading Radian Chain Mempool Lab

Start with the README, then open `metadata/project.json` to check the constants behind the examples. After that, `fixtures/cases.csv` shows the compact path and `examples/extended_cases.csv` gives a wider look at the same rule.

## Design Sketch

The interesting part is the boundary between accepted and reviewed scenarios. Extended examples sit near that boundary so future edits can show whether the model became more permissive or more cautious. The C implementation keeps headers, source, and assertions separate so bounds and types are easy to review.

## Purpose

The repository exists to keep a technical idea small enough to reason about. The implementation avoids external dependencies where possible, then uses fixtures to make changes easy to review.

## What It Does

- Uses fixture data to keep event replay changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for invariant checks, including `recovery` and `degraded`.
- Documents settlement rules tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.

## Fixture Notes

The extended cases are not random smoke tests. `degraded` keeps pressure on the review path, while `recovery` shows the model when capacity and weight are strong enough to clear the threshold.

## Files Worth Reading

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Setup

Use a normal shell with C available on `PATH`. The verifier is written as a PowerShell script because the portfolio was assembled on Windows.

## Usage

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Verification

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Limits

The repository favors determinism over breadth. It does not pull live data, keep secrets, or depend on network access for verification.

## Next Directions

- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add a short report command that prints the score breakdown for a single scenario.
- Add one more blockchain tooling fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.
